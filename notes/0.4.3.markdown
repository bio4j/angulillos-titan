**IMPORTANT** *This version is affected by [the arities bug](https://github.com/bio4j/angulillos/pull/86). Update to [0.4.9](https://github.com/bio4j/angulillos-titan/releases/tag/v0.4.9).*

- make UntypedTitanGraph AutoCloseable
- make ConcurrentTransaction override close to close itself

Note that close in TitanUntypedGraph will only close the thread-local transaction, **not** the graph; for that use shutdown.
