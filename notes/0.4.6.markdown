**IMPORTANT** *This version is affected by [the arities bug](https://github.com/bio4j/angulillos/pull/86). Update to [0.4.9](https://github.com/bio4j/angulillos-titan/releases/tag/v0.4.9).*

This release removes the check on vertex/edge label when querying through a property. Properties are globally unique, so it does not add anything to check that their source is correctly typed.
